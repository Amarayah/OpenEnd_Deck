# OpenEnd_Deck
Welcome to this collection of open-source API endpoints! This repository is a personal project where I'm practicing my coding skills, primarily using various tutorials and tools. My goal is to build quite the deck of functional and well-documented(hopefully) endpoints that anyone can use and learn from.

## What's Inside?
You'll find various API endpoints here, built with different technologies and serving different purposes. Each endpoint is designed to be standalone.

## How You Can Use These Endpoints
Feel free to explore, integrate, and utilize these endpoints in your own projects! They are completely open for use. Whether you're building a new application, testing a concept, or just need a quick data source, you're welcome to use what you find here.

## Contribute and Collaborate
This is a learning journey for me, and I'd love for you to be a part of it!

- __Fork the repository:__ Make your own copy and experiment.

- __Suggest improvements:__ Open an issue to share your ideas or point out areas for refinement.

- __Submit pull requests:__ If you've improved an endpoint, fixed a bug, or added something new, please contribute back!

- __Offer pointers:__ Since I'm learning, I would love to get your feedback. If you have any advice for me, you know, like, best practices, or better ways to approach something, please share your thoughts with me in the issues or pull request comments. All constructive criticism is welcome.

### Attribution
If you use any of these endpoints in your projects, a credit back to this repository would be greatly appreciated but isn't strictly required. Knowing that my work is useful to others is its own reward!
