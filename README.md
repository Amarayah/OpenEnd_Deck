# OpenEnd_Deck
Welcome to this collection of open-source API endpoints! This repository is a personal project where I'm practicing my coding skills, primarily using various tutorials and tools. My goal is to build quite the deck of functional and well-documented(hopefully) endpoints that anyone can use and learn from.

## What's Inside?
You'll find various API endpoints here, built with different technologies and serving different purposes. Each endpoint is designed to be standalone.

## How You Can Use These Endpoints
Feel free to explore, integrate, and utilize these endpoints in your own projects! They are completely open source under the MIT License (a common open-source license that allows broad use with attribution). Whether you're building a new application, testing a concept, or just need a quick data source, you're welcome to use what you find here.

## Contribute and Collaborate
This is a learning journey for me, and I'd love for you to be a part of it!

....* Fork the repository: Make your own copy and experiment.

....* Suggest improvements: Open an issue to share your ideas or point out areas for refinement.

....* Submit pull requests: If you've improved an endpoint, fixed a bug, or added something new, please contribute back!

....* Offer pointers: Since I'm learning, I highly value feedback. If you have advice, best practices, or better ways to approach something, please share your knowledge in the issues or pull request comments. All constructive criticism is welcome.

### Attribution
If you use any of these endpoints in your projects, a credit back to this repository would be greatly appreciated but isn't strictly required. Knowing that my work is useful to others is its own reward!

__Happy coding!__
